# Text recognition using machine learning
This MLOCR will recognize any text in an image and will extract the text content. It will print the YOLO format label for the co-ordinate of the text in the image. It is also possible to view the classification or text identification result in a viewer. Text region classification can be added manually. I shall show you the step by step procedure how to run the MLOCR using the exe without having headace about code. But I shall describe a little about code.  

## How to Run the Software
You donâ€™t need to install Python or any dependencies to run the software. 
   ```sh
# 1. Go to the dist folder
#    (e.g., ODAI\dist)

# 2. Copy the dist directory to your local disk

# 3. Open Command Prompt (or a terminal)

# 4. Navigate to the copied dist folder
cd pathtolocal\dist

# 5. Run the executable
