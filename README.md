# Text recognition using machine learning
This MLOCR will recognize any text in an image and will extract the text content. It will print the YOLO format label for the co-ordinate of the text in the image. It is also possible to view the classification or text identification result in a viewer. Text region classification can be added manually. I shall show you the step by step procedure how to run the MLOCR using the exe without having headace about code. But I shall describe a little about code.
